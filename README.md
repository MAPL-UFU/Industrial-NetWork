# Industrial-NetWork

Teaching technical disciplines faces access challenges due to the high cost of specific equipment, and with the transition to a hybrid in-person-remote model, the need for remote laboratories becomes evident. In this context, pedagogical trends such as IoT and remote laboratories gain prominence. Protocols like I2C, Ethernet, and ZigBee are fundamental in industrial. All of these protocols can be implemented in practice using low-cost platforms such as Arduino, however, their implementation is not trivial. This article develops specific libraries for these protocols with the aim of facilitating the initialization, implementation and generation of data packets. The development of libraries such as I2C.h, Ethernet_UDP.h, and Xbee_API.h has significantly improved the effectiveness of laboratory practices in the Industrial Networks discipline at the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia, expanding students' access to essential technologies.
